# Continuous Integration Vs Branching

-   ci means working with our changes always visible to everyone in the team.
-   branching is the opposite of ci.
-   branching means hiding changes from the main part of the code.
-   we should minimize the amount of changes in every PR.
-   we should commit constantly throughout the day, at least once.
-   we should be comfortable with committing **partially complete features**
-   if we are doing continuous delivery **CD**, we should be comfortable with our **partially complete features going into production**.
-   separate **deployment** from **release**, deploying if different from releasing a feature for people to use.
-   partially complete features can be deployed, but they are not ready to be released yet.
