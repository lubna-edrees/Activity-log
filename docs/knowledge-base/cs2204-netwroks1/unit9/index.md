-   Private IP address range:
    -   Class A: 10.0.0.0 — 10.255.255.255
    -   Class B: 172.16.0.0 — 172.31.255.255
    -   Class C: 192.168.0.0 — 192.168.255.255
-   private IPv4 address are the IP address of the device in the local network; they exposed to the outer network behind the router's IP address.
-   private IPv6 addresses can be reused for every network.
-   the most common default private IP address format is 192.168.x.y; private IP can be found in the device settings and it is assigned to the device by the router.
-   public IPv4 addresses (router IP) must be unique; and assigned to your router by the ISP;
-   **attenuation**: The degeneration of a signal over distance on a network cable.
-   encoding:

    -   100MB Fast Ethernet => 4B/5B
    -   Gigabit Ethernet 1000Base-T => PAM-5

-   Routing algorithms:
    -   Routing Information Protocol (RIP) => distance vector
    -   ISP => link-state routing
