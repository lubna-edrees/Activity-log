# thinking\_logically\_games

These interactive puzzles are taken from the [Introduction to Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/discrete-mathematics). They are optional, but we strongly encourage you to solve them: they will help you to "invent" the key algorithmic ideas on your own and will help you to solve the programming challenges. Even if you fail to solve some puzzles, the time will not be lost as you will better appreciate the beauty and power of the underlying ideas.

## games list:

### Balls in Boxes :

Distribute N black balls among 10 boxes so that every two boxes have different number of balls \(you can put 0 balls in some box if you want to\). Fill in numbers of black balls in each box below.

### Two Adjacent Cells of Opposite Colors

You are given 20 black and white cells. The leftmost one is white, the rightmost one is black, the colors of all other cells are hidden. You can reveal the color of a cell by clicking on it. Your goal is to find two adjacent cells of different colors by using at most 5 clicks.
