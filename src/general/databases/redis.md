# Redis

* `redis` on windows will never work with `docker` unless you bind the `IP` of the docker machine to match the ip of your local machine or vice-versa.
* `redis` on windows, you need to start the service manually by:
  1. `ctrl + alt + del` 
  2. go to `service` tab
  3. search for `Redis` and start the service.
